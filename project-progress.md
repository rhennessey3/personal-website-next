## Current Status
Backend infrastructure and database structure are complete and operational. The frontend implementation has made significant progress:

1. **Frontend Progress**:
   - Next.js application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint is set up
   - Basic layout with responsive design and navigation is implemented
   - shadcn/ui components are integrated (Button, Card, etc.)
   - Initial versions of Home, Thinking, and About pages are created with mock data
   - Contact form component created with API integration
   - Admin dashboard and login pages implemented
   - API client created for backend communication

2. **Backend Status**:
   - Express.js server with TypeScript is fully operational
   - API routes and controllers for all required endpoints are implemented
   - Supabase integration is complete with proper database schema
   - Authentication middleware is in place
   
3. **Current Development Environment**:
   - Frontend server running on port 3000
   - Backend server running on port 5001
   - Monorepo structure with shared packages is configured
   - Environment variables set up for API and Supabase connections

## Preparation Checklist for Frontend Implementation

### 1. Environment Setup
- [x] Set up Next.js frontend application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint
- [ ] Copy these environment variables from backend to a new frontend .env file:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
  ```

### 2. Backend Verification
- [x] Ensure backend server is running on port 5001
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints are working:
  - GET /api/health
  - POST /api/auth/login
  - GET /api/profile
  - GET /api/case-studies
  - GET /api/blog-posts

### 3. Supabase Access
- [x] Confirm access to Supabase project
- [x] Verify storage bucket permissions
- [x] Test admin user login credentials

### 4. Development Environment
- [x] Node.js version 18+ installed
- [x] pnpm installed globally
- [x] VSCode extensions:
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
  - TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features

### 5. Design Assets
- [x] Prepare brand colors (implemented in Tailwind theme)
- [ ] Collect any logos/icons
- [x] Define typography choices (Geist Sans and Geist Mono fonts)
- [x] List required UI components (shadcn/ui components)

### 6. Content Preparation
- [x] Draft homepage content (implemented in page.tsx)
- [x] Prepare initial blog post (mock data in thinking/page.tsx)
- [x] Create sample case study (mock data in thinking/page.tsx)
- [x] Write about page content (implemented in about/page.tsx)

### 7. Commands to Start Development
```bash
# Start backend server
cd apps/backend
pnpm dev

# In a new terminal, start frontend
cd apps/frontend
pnpm dev
```

### 8. Additional Development Commands
```bash
# Add new shadcn/ui components
cd apps/frontend
npx shadcn-ui add [component-name]

# Install Aceternity UI dependencies
cd apps/frontend
pnpm add framer-motion

# Build the entire project
pnpm build
```

### 9. Documentation
- [x] Review API documentation in test.http
- [x] Understand shared type definitions in packages/shared
- [x] Review authentication flow in middleware/auth.ts

### 10. Next Implementation Priorities
1. **Fix Development Environment Issues** - Resolve Next.js server errors to ensure stable development
2. **Connect to Backend API** - Test the API client with the actual backend server
3. **Complete Admin Dashboard** - Implement the remaining admin dashboard features:
   - Case study editor
   - Blog post editor
   - Profile management
4. **Image Upload Pipeline** - Set up image upload and management system
5. **Testing and Deployment** - Prepare for production deployment

This updated checklist reflects our current progress and outlines the next steps for continuing the frontend implementation phase.

### 11. Project Plan
The project plan has been consolidated into a single document: `combined-personal-website-plan.md`, which merges the best elements from the original monorepo plan and the revised plan.
