## Preparation Checklist for Frontend Implementation

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Copy these environment variables from backend to a new frontend .env file:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
  ```

### 2. Backend Verification
- [ ] Ensure backend server is running on port 5001
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints are working:
  - GET /api/health
  - POST /api/auth/login
  - GET /api/profile
  - GET /api/case-studies
  - GET /api/blog-posts

### 3. Supabase Access
- [ ] Confirm access to Supabase project
- [ ] Verify storage bucket permissions
- [ ] Test admin user login credentials

### 4. Development Environment
- [ ] Node.js version 18+ installed
- [ ] pnpm installed globally
- [ ] VSCode extensions:
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
  - TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features

### 5. Design Assets
- [ ] Prepare brand colors
- [ ] Collect any logos/icons
- [ ] Define typography choices
- [ ] List required UI components

### 6. Content Preparation
- [ ] Draft homepage content
- [ ] Prepare initial blog post
- [ ] Create sample case study
- [ ] Write about page content

### 7. Commands to Start Development
```bash
# Start backend server
cd apps/backend
pnpm dev

# In a new terminal, create and start frontend
cd apps/frontend
pnpm create next-app . --typescript --tailwind --eslint
pnpm dev
```

### 8. Documentation
- [ ] Review API documentation in test.http
- [ ] Understand shared type definitions in packages/shared
- [ ] Review authentication flow in middleware/auth.ts

This checklist ensures you have all necessary resources, access, and understanding to begin the frontend implementation phase effectively.
